# Overview
In the 40+ years since the release of the original film, the Star Wars universe has vastly expanded beyond characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo & Darth Vader. Today, there is not only a large assortment of characters, species & planets to learn about, but there is also a vast history predating what we know as the "Skywalker Saga." This index provides insight into this vast collection of lore that the Star Wars universe is comprised of.
